 Network Access Control solutions are a simple idea, 802.1X cert based 
 authentication, great! works like a charm. However, businesses are complex 
 beasts and not all systems on that network support 802.1X and/or cert based 
 authenticaiton.
 
 In this situation most look to simple MAC authentication to handle the
 exceptions. 
 
 So if lets say your IP phones are on the same network, if we can find the
 correct MAC address we can essential spoof that address and access the network.

 This utility was designed for exactly this, MAC address manipulation and brute
 forcing.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  -set                  Set specific MAC address "Required: -mac, -interface"
  -mac                  Address required for "Required: -set"
  -brute                Brute force a MAC address, NAC bypassing
  -random               Set a random MAC address
  -list                 List current interfaces on the system
  -reset                Reset MAC address to default
  -interface            Interface to be manipulated
