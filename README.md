MAC Address brute forcing tool, used to bypass MAC based filtering

Network Access Control solutions are a simple idea, 802.1X cert based 
authentication, great! works like a charm. However, businesses are complex 
beasts and not all systems on that network support 802.1X and/or cert based 
authenticaiton.
 
In this situation most look to simple MAC authentication to handle the
exceptions. 
 
So if lets say your IP phones are on the same network, if we can find the
correct MAC address we can essential spoof that address and access the network.

This utility was designed for exactly this, MAC address manipulation and brute
forcing.
